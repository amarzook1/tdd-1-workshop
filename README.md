# Exercise 1: Animal greeter
Write me a class with a method that I can pass my name and the name of an animal to, and then it greets me as that animal. For example, if I passed it "Kay" and "Cow" it would say something like "Moo! Kay!".

Implement this for Cow, Chicken, Alien, Horse, and however many animals you like.

Stop when you feel comfortable that you are TDDing effectively. Ask a coach to observe if you like!
